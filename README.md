# About the code
This code creates a website for the 2024 - 2025 FBLA Website Coding and Development competition. The website is supposed to be run by the school to help students find jobs. Employers can post job openings, to which students can apply to. The employers then would be able to accept or reject student applications. When posting the job, the employers have to enter how far away the location is from the school and relevant tags related to the job (for example, a cashier job would have the math tag on it because they have to deal with money). They will also post the salary. Then, the job has to get approved or declined by the school administrator. After the job is approved, students can see and apply to that job. Students can also request letters of recomendation from their teachers to give to their potential employers. They are also able to see what jobs they have applied to.
